This folder is intended to hold certificate PDF files and related assets.

Notes:
- Move your certificate PDFs (e.g. `AIC_2025_Presentation_Certificate.pdf`) into this folder to keep `public/` root tidy.
- If you move files, update `utils/certificates.js` paths to point to `/certificates/<filename>`.

Example:
- `/certificates/AIC_2025_Presentation_Certificate.pdf`

You can also add thumbnail images here and reference them from `components/Certificates.js`.
